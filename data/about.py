        As an AI/ML Engineer with over 3 years of experience, I specialize in transforming complex business challenges into 
        intelligent, scalable solutions. My journey began at Pune Institute of Computer Technology, where I graduated as the 
        Institute Topper with a 9.87 CGPA, and has evolved into a passion for building AI systems that make a real impact.
        
        Currently serving as AIML Engineer II at Ciklum India, I lead research initiatives and architect end-to-end AI solutions 
        that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and production deployment. My work spans the entire AI spectrumâ€”from 
        traditional machine learning algorithms to state-of-the-art generative AI applications.
        
        What drives me is the challenge of making AI not just intelligent, but practical and useful. Whether it's developing 
        conversational agents that understand context, building computer vision systems that see the world accurately, or 
        creating data pipelines that process millions of records efficiently, I'm committed to delivering solutions that 
        genuinely solve problems and create value.
